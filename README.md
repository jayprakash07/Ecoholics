## Your Trash is your Treasure

Our project gives people the opportunity to improve the world while making profit for themselves. People can drop off recyclable material at our various Eco-Zone locations all throughout Canada. All that's left for our clients to do when they reach the Eco-Zone is scan the QR code from their mobile app, weigh the recyclable materials and get paid. We will give the collected material to companies like Aluminum Recycling, OM Scrap Metal, Recycle for Cash, and many more in return for a profit so our business can continue to function. Once we get paid we will give our clients E-Credits called Eco, that can be redeemed for gift cards, donations to charity, and many other rewards. You may be wondering why clients reach out directly to companies like Aluminum Recycling, OM Scrap Metal, Recycle for Cash. It is because such companies only deal with large scale manufacturing businesses which donate scraps from defective product batches and don’t provide any sort of compensation for the lone community member.
